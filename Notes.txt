Here's a shell script to automate the backup of a GitHub repository and copy it to an AWS S3 bucket. This script uses the GitHub API to download the repository as a .tar.gz archive and the AWS CLI to upload it to S3.
Instructions to Use:

    Prerequisites:
        Install curl (to download the GitHub repository).
        Install the AWS CLI (to interact with S3).
        Configure the AWS CLI with your access key, secret key, and default region using aws configure.

    Update the Script:
        Replace your_github_token with your GitHub Personal Access Token.
        Replace your_github_username_or_org with your GitHub username or organization name.
        Replace your_repo_name with the name of the repository you want to back up.
        Replace your_s3_bucket_name with your AWS S3 bucket name.
        Replace your_s3_region with your S3 region.

    Run the Script:
        Save the script as github_backup_to_s3.sh.
        Make the script executable:
        bash

chmod +x github_backup_to_s3.sh

Run the script:
bash

        ./github_backup_to_s3.sh

Key Notes:

    The script downloads the repository as a tarball (compressed format) from GitHub using your personal access token.
    The tarball is uploaded to the specified S3 bucket.
    Temporary files are removed after the upload to keep the system clean.
